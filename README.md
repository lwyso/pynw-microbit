The BBC Micro:bit is a low cost pocket-sized computer, the device has motion detection, built in compass, bluetooth technology, and quite a few other functions as well. It is for use in teaching computing at schools, and was given to every child in year 7 across the UK in 2016​. 

In the session, we will​ be looking ​at a number of projects​ created by the wider community, followed by a hands on coding session, write your own code in MicroPython, and then a show and tell of your project at the end.

## Writing your code

You can write code to operate the micro:bit by:

- using the [online code editor - All options](http://microbit.org/code/)
- [JavaScript Blocks Editor](https://pxt.microbit.org/?lang=en)
- [MicroPython Editor](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html)

Once you are happy with your code, you can save, download and then drag the hex file to the micro:bit!
